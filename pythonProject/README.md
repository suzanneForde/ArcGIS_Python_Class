# Class Coding Assignments Repository

This repository serves as a portfolio of my coding work for the in-class coding courses. Below is a brief overview of the contents:

## 1. Class_#

This directory contains code from in-class coding sessions. Each subdirectory corresponds to a specific session and includes the code written during that session.

## 2. Code_Chall

Here, you'll find completed solo assignments undertaken prior to each class session. These assignments were designed to reinforce learning through individual practice. Each assignment is numbered and includes the corresponding code.

## 3. Toolbox_Final

This directory houses my final assignment for the course, the Python Toolbox. I dreated one toolbox with three tools:
- Field Lister Tool
- Buffer Tool
- Polygon Area Tool
