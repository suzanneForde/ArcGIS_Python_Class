# Class Coding Assignments Repository

This repository serves as a portfolio of my coding work for the in-class coding courses. Below is a brief overview of the contents:

## 1.  Code_Chall

Here, you'll find completed solo assignments undertaken prior to each class session. These assignments were designed to reinforce learning through individual practice. Each assignment is numbered and includes the corresponding code.

## 2. Lecture_Codes

This directory contains code from in-class coding sessions. Each subdirectory corresponds to a specific session and includes the code written during that session.

## 3. Midterm_Tool

You'll find my midterm coding challenge in this directory. I conducted a proximity analysis of bus stops within 1 mile of libraries. This information could be used to create a bus guide for local residents in need of books or other materials.

## 4. Toolbox_Final

This directory houses my final assignment for the course, the Python Toolbox. I created one toolbox with three tools:
- Field Lister Tool
- Buffer Tool
- Polygon Area Tool
