# Objective: utilize arcpy.da module to undertake some basic partitioning of dataset.
# Work with the Forest Health Works dataset from RI GIS (provided as a downloadable ZIP file in this repository).
# Using the arcpy.da module, extract all sites that have a photo of the invasive species (Field: PHOTO)
# into a new Shapefile, and do some basic counts of the dataset.
# In summary, addressing the following:
# 1. Count how many individual records have photos, and how many do not (2 numbers), print the results.
# 2. Count how many unique species there are in the dataset, print the result.
# 3. Generate two shapefiles, one with photos and the other without.
