# Hello there!



## My name is **Suzie**,


I'm currently a second-year graduate student in the Master of Environmental Science and Management at the University of Rhode Island. My specialization is in environmental planning and design, and I'm currently working towards two graduate certificates in community planning and GIS and remote sensing. In undergrad, I double majored in Marine Affairs (B.A.) and English (B.A.) also at URI.

Here's a portrait of me. I cut the background out and inserted a picture I took of a small reef tank.
