# Hello there!



## My name is **Suzie**,


I'm currently a second-year graduate student in the Master of Environmental Science and Management @ the University of Rhode Island. My specialization is in environmental planning and design, and I'm currently working towards two graduate certificates in community planning and GIS and remote sensing.
